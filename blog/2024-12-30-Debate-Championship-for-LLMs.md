> _5 LLMs, 1vs1 matches to produce the most convincing argumentation in favor or against a random motion. Oh, and also the debate judge is an LLM :)_

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized our everyday life since the launch of ChatGPT in november 2022: OpenAI's LLM-powered chat application gained one million users in 5 days and, in October 2024, after almost two years from each launch, reached [3.7 billions of visit in a single month](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), putting it 11th on the shortlists of the [most visited websites](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/most-visited-websites).

This broad adoption of text-generating Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also reflected in the skyrocketing number of LLM releases by numerous companies: while OpenAI, Anthropic or other big AI companies build mostly closed-source products, these new models, available mainly on [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), are mostly open-weight or open-source (for an explanation of the difference see [this article](https://www.agora.software/en/llm-open-source-open-weight-or-proprietary/)). Leading the open AI revolution are companies like Meta, Qwen (by Alibaba), Huggingface (HF), Microsoft and many others.

Open models are progressively getting closer in performance to their closed-source counterparts, matching them in many tasks like coding or, with the latest releases, reasoning.

With open LLMs becoming better at complex jobs, one of the fields they can be tested on is _debating_. There has been some research already on the topic, whose most relevant contributions can be summarized with:

- Agent4Debate ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04472)): a collaborative framework leveraging a Searcher, an Analyzer, a Writer and a Reviewer to mimic human behavior for debate preparation and execution. Evaluated against human and other baseline models, Agent4Debate demonstrated human-comparable capabilities
- Debatrix ([Liang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08010)): a comprehensive LLM judge for multi-turn debate settings
- Debates used to evaluate the performance of LLMs ([Moniri et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11044)): an automated evaluation framework based on debates among LLMs which are judged by another LLM. This helps in scaling the benchmarking of Language models outside domain-specific knowledge or fixed test sets
- DebateBrawl ([Aryan, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06229)): a platform that, integrating genetic algorithms and game theory strategies with LLM reasoning and text generation capabilities, provides the users with an interactive debate experience by crafting coherent and poignant arguments.

In this blog post, we will propose a Debate Championship among five state-of-the-art open models available through [HuggingFace Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2a. General Structure of the Tournament

The tournament is structured with the so called "Italian" formula, meaning that all participants play with all the others. There is no "home and away games" schema: every participant plays with each of the other ones only once. A model earns one point by winning a game, whereas it does not earn any (but it does not lose any as well) when losing a game.

Each tournament round is one-shot, meaning that each participant has only one possibility to generate a 150-250 words argument, that will be then judged by an external LLM.

This first tournament consists of 5 LLMs as _debaters_:

- [`meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
- [`Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct)
- [`microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct)
- [`HuggingFaceH4/starchat2-15b-v0.1`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/starchat2-15b-v0.1)
- [`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3)

And two as _judges_:

- [`Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview)
- [`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct)

### 2b. Data Collection and Processing

> _Code reference: [DebateChampionshipLLMs.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/DebateChampionshipLLMs.ipynb)_

The motions which were used to prompt the debate matches were extracted from [`kokhayas/english-debate-motions-utds`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kokhayas/english-debate-motions-utds) dataset on HuggingFace.

1,000 of them were then randomly sampled from the 10,000+ set of motions contained in the original dataset, and a random motion was selected for each debate round.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# download the dataset from HF hub
dts = load_dataset("kokhayas/english-debate-motions-utds")
dtsdct = dts["train"]

import random as r

# sample 1000 motions from the original dataset
motions = dtsdct["motion"]
motions2use = []
numbers = []
j = 0
while j < 1000:
    n = r.randint(0,10000)
    if n not in numbers:
        numbers.append(n)
        if motions[n].lower().startswith("th"):
            motions2use.append(motions[n])
            j+=1
        else:
            continue
    else:
        continue
```

### 2c. Building and Running the Tournament

> _Code reference: [DebateChampionshipLLMs.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/DebateChampionshipLLMs.ipynb)_

We approached building the tournament by:

- decomposing it into its atomic parts, the "building blocks" (defining how debaters and judges generate their answers)
- scaling to creating the structure of one round (debater 1 -> debater 2 -> judge)
- defining the entire tournament as a loop of rounds, with debate data collection and points tracking (for the final ranking)

The code to create the building blocks of the debate tournament is the following:

````python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient
from google.colab import userdata

# create an HF client for inference
hf_token = userdata.get('HF_TOKEN_INFERENCE')
client = InferenceClient(api_key=hf_token)

# define a function for the debaters to produce their argument
def debate_inference(model, prompt):
  messages = [
	  {"role": "system", "content": "You are skilled in competitive debate. You produce arguments that strictly adhere to the position you are required to take by the prompts you are proposed with"},
	  {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
  ]
  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
  	messages=messages,
  	temperature=0.5,
  	max_tokens=2048,
  	top_p=0.7
  )
  return completion.choices[0].message.content

# define a function for the judges to produce their verdict
def judge_inference(model, motion, essay1, essay2):
  messages = [
	  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a judge, based on the motion, the argumentation in favor of it and the argumentation against it, you should produce a JSON string that contains the following fields:\n\n- winner (str): can take only FAVOR or AGAINST as values, based on who you think the winner is\n- reasons (str): the reasons why you chose the winner. OUTPUT ONLY THE JSON STRING AS: '''\n\n```json\n{\"winner\": 'FAVOR'|'AGAINST', \"reasons\": 'Reasons why you chose the winner'}\n```\n\n'''"},
	  {"role": "user", "content": "MOTION:\n"+motion},
	  {"role": "user", "content": "ARGUMENT IN FAVOR:\n"+essay1},
	  {"role": "user", "content": "ARGUMENT AGAINST:\n"+essay2},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the winner? OUTPUT ONLY THE JSON STRING AS: '''\n\n```json\n{\"winner\": 'FAVOR'|'AGAINST', \"reasons\": 'Reasons why you chose the winner'}\n```\n\n'''"}
  ]
  completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
  	messages=messages,
  	temperature=0,
  	max_tokens=2048,
  	top_p=0.7
  )
  return completion.choices[0].message.content

# define a tournament round
def tournament_round(model1, model2, judge, motion):
  prompt1 = "Produce an essay of maximum 150 words in favor of this motion: " + motion
  prompt2 = "Produce an essay of maximum 150 words against this motion: " + motion
  essay1 = debate_inference(model1, prompt1)
  essay2 = debate_inference(model2, prompt2)
  winner_answer = judge_inference(judge, motion, essay1, essay2)
  return essay1, essay2, winner_answer
````

For the tournament itself to be run, we add the following features to the backbone structure:

- Point tracking
- Debate data collection
- _winner_ and _reasons for winner's choice_ extraction from the judge's answer

The last point is especially painful, since the judge's answer can come in various formats even if the system instructions are very clear on how to structure it, so we decided to tackle the challenge posed by the variability of the output by adding a _output parser_ LLM. This output parser LLM is `gpt-4o-mini`, that is wrapped into Langchain OpenAI chat class (`ChatOpenaAI`), and linked to a Pydantic schema for structured output generation:

```python
from google.colab import userdata
import os

# set OpenAI API key as an environment variable
a = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = a

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field

# generate a chat prompt template with Langchain, to wrap your system instructions for the model
GPT_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=GPT_MODEL)
system_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            """You are a helpful assistant. Your job is to restructure the virdict from a debate competition so that it follows this structure:
            - winner: the winner, as reported by the virdict
            - reasons: reasons for the choice of the winner
            Strictly follow the virdict you are provided with, do not add/make up any information."""),
        ("human", "{message}"),
    ]
)

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# create a Pydantic BaseModel for structured output generation
class Verdict(BaseModel):
    """Structure of the output of a debate competition verdict"""
    winner: str = Field(description="The winner, as reported by the verdict")
    reasons: str = Field(description="Reasons for the choice of the winner")

# define an inference-ready system instructions+LLM+structured output parser
chain = system_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(Verdict)
```

Now we can run the tournament:

```python
import time

# define points tracker
modelpoints = {judges[i]: {model: 0 for model in models} for i in range(len(judges))}

# define data collector
motions2args2winner2reasons = {"motions": [], "judge": [], "favor_model": [], "favor_arg": [], "against_model": [], "against_arg": [], "winner": [], "reasons": [], "total_time": []}

judge_counter = 0
for judge in judges:
  judge_counter+=1
  pairs = []
  counter = 0
  for i in range(len(models)):
    for j in range(len(models)):
      # only make two models play with each other if they have not met before
      if i!=j and (i,j) not in pairs and (j,i) not in pairs:
        counter+=1
        pairs.append((i,j))
        motion = r.choice(motions2use)
        favoragainst = {"favor": models[i], "against": models[j]}
        s = time.time()
        favor_arg, against_arg, winner_json = tournament_round(models[i], models[j], judge, motion)
        e = time.time()
        # add debate data to data collector
        motions2args2winner2reasons["total_time"].append(e-s)
        motions2args2winner2reasons["judge"].append(judge)
        motions2args2winner2reasons["motions"].append(motion)
        motions2args2winner2reasons["favor_model"].append(favoragainst["favor"])
        motions2args2winner2reasons["favor_arg"].append(favor_arg)
        motions2args2winner2reasons["against_model"].append(favoragainst["against"])
        motions2args2winner2reasons["against_arg"].append(against_arg)
        virdict = chain.invoke({"message": winner_json})
        reasons = virdict.reasons
        winner = virdict.winner
        winner_model = favoragainst[winner.lower()]
        motions2args2winner2reasons["winner"].append(winner_model)
        motions2args2winner2reasons["reasons"].append(reasons)
        # add a point to the winner model
        modelpoints[judge][winner_model] += 1
        print(f"Done with match: {judge_counter}.{counter}")
  print("Done with " + judge + " being a judge")
```

The collected data were manually annotated ([_Code reference_](<>)), saved to a CSV file and uploaded as [a dataset on HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/as-cle-bert/DebateLLMs).

### 2d. Post-Tournament Analysis

> _Code references: [DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb) and [MotionCategoriesAssociations.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/MotionCategoriesAssociations.ipynb)_

Post-tournament analysis involved:

1. Analyzing words in motions and winning arguments when `QwQ-32B-Preview` was a judge
2. Repeating the same analysis at 1. with `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` as a judge
3. Repeating the same analysis at 1. with `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` winning arguments
4. Repeating the same analysis at 1. with with `HuggingFaceH4/starchat2-15b-v0.1` losing arguments

We also carried out topic association analysis for winning arguments with `QwQ-32B-Preview` and `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` as judges, as well as the same analysis for `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` winning arguments and `HuggingFaceH4/starchat2-15b-v0.1` losing arguments.

## 3. Results and Conclusions

### 3a. Tournament Results

The tournament was won by `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`, with 5 overall victories and with being the winner also of the tournament batch in which `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` was the judge (Fig 1).

It was followed, in the second place, by `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` (4 victories, winner of the tournament batch in which `QwQ-32B-Preview` was judge), `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` (4 overall victories) and `Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` (4 overall victories).

In the third position we had `starchat2-15b-v0.1`, with 2 overall victories.

### 3b. Favor and Against Winning Cases Distribution

> _Code reference: [DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb)_

We first evaluated the "Favor" vs "Against" tendency for the two judges when deciding the winning arguments:

- `QwQ-32B-Preview` chose 5 times "Favor" and 5 times "Against"
- `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` chose 7 times "Favor" and 3 times "Against"

We repeated the same analysis for the cases in which `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` was the winner and for those in which `starchat2-15b-v0.1` was the loser:

- `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` won 3 time as "Favor" and 2 times as "Against"
- `starchat2-15b-v0.1` lost only when being "Against" the motion (and won twice while being in the "Favor" position and once while being "Against")

### 3c. Overlapping between Key Words in Motions and Arguments

> _Code reference: [DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/DebateLLMChampionship_analysis.ipynb)_

We evaluated the overlapping score between the keywords in the motions and the keywords in the winning arguments in various settings:

- We evidenced broad variation of overlapping scores both with `QwQ-32B-Preview` and with `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` as judges. Both the variation ranges were comparable, with the one in the winning arguments from `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` being slightly narrower (Fig 2a-b)
- The overlapping scores for the winning prompts from `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` were comparable with the ones registered for the previous point, but the variation was far broader than the one found for the losing prompts by `starchat2-15b-v0.1` (Fig 2c-d)

_**Fig 2d**: Overlapping scores between the keywords in the motions and the keywords in the winning arguments distributions for losing arguments by starchat2-15b-v0.1_

> **TAKEAWAY**: _Although results do not converge onto a single explanation, we could say that a high overlap score does not necessary help in winning, but that a low overlap score may have an influence on losing the match_

We also evaluated the correlation among argument length (in words) and keyword overlapping score: while for overall winning arguments with both `QwQ-32B-Preview` and `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` as judges there is no significant correlation, Fig 3a-b highlight that there is a stronger positive correlation for `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` winning argument and a stronger negative correlation for `starchat2-15b-v0.1` losing arguments.

_**Fig 3b**: Correlation between keyword overlapping scores and argument length for losing arguments by starchat2-15b-v0.1_

> **TAKEAWAY**: _This correlation study might point at the fact that `starchat2-15b-v0.1` was not able to maintain adherence to the original motion when producing longer arguments, and that might have lead to losing the matches. The ability of maintaining a broader correspondence to the original motion when producing longer arguments might, on the other hand, have influenced `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` victories._

### 3d. Motion Topics and Winning Arguments Correlation

> _Code reference: [MotionCategoriesAssociations.ipynb](https://github.com/AstraBert/DebateLLM-Championship/blob/main/MotionCategoriesAssociations.ipynb)_

We lastly evaluated what positions ("Favor" or "Against") were deemed winning in correlation to the topic of their motions.

First of all, we accounted for potential "personal opinion" influence (i.e. a bias in the LLM) in the choice of the winner, using `gpt-4o-mini` to detect these biases and report them along with the expressions that contained "personal opinions" from the judge. We then build Table 1:

_**Table 1**: Potential influence of judge's "personal opinion" in choosing the winner_

Table 1 highlights that `QwQ-32B-Preview` showed "personal opinion" influence in 30% of the cases, whereas `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` in 50% of them: the difference might rely in the intrinsic reasoning structure that `QwQ-32B-Preview` has, which might help avoiding bias-fed pitfalls in the judgement.

From Table 1 we can also see that both judges choose winning positions (except in few cases) that align with more liberal/left-leaning positions, which might be due to the political "bias" of LLMs, that all seem to align to libera/left-wing/social-democratic views ([Rozado, 2024](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621)). To better asses the political leaning of our LLMs, we performed the political compass test on `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` (judge), `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` and `starchat2-15b-v0.1` (the winner and the loser of the tournament) (Fig 4).

_**Fig 4**: Political compass of the three evaluated LLMs_

The political compass gives insight on left-leaning, libertarian positions for the three evaluated LLMs: this might mean that the judges positions in the choice of the were influenced by an internal political bias. The intrinsic political leaning of the models may have influenced also the winning chances for `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` and `starchat2-15b-v0.1` (Table 2):

As you can see, `starchat2-15b-v0.1` needed to defend the position _against_ several issues that are generally supported by liberal/left-wing political views: in this sense, the model might have hard a hard time generating a valid argument.

On the other side, all the positions that `Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` had to defend were aligned with its political views, making it easier for thr LLM to generate convincing and winning arguments.

> **TAKEAWAY**: _There might be a correlation between the political leanings of the LLMs and their preferences in winner choice/ability to generate convincing arguments_
